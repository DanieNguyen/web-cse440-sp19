__Important!__ 

This year we would like you to submit a contribution statement along with each group submission (for all assignments, not just for Assignment 1!). Include this contribution statement at the top of your submission, along with the names of your group members. Please note that we will not grade submissions where this statement is missing. 

An example contribution statement for Assignment 1b is:  

- Name 1: 40%, researched the background of the problem, outlined the content of the document, wrote the first version of one paragraph, also selected the images to be included
- Name 2: 10%, proof-read the PDF, fixed several typos
- Name 3: 25%, wrote the first version of the background section, made sure the final version got submitted
- Name 4: 25%, organized the group meeting, researched the background of the problem, contributed to the formatting of the text

Please know that we do not expect everyone to contribute equally to each assignment, but you should try to work as a team and support each other. You should also discuss and agree among each other what each of you contributed and how much this contributed to the overall assignments. We know these percentages are subjective and messy, so don’t overthink them (we wont either).

# Overview

You are to propose a __problem__ and an __approach__ that could form the basis of a project for this course.
Successful projects will observe the need for good human-centered design in an interactive computing system, 
analyze the needs and opportunities in the problem, explore potential designs, and propose a compelling solution.

This assignment is worth __5 out of 100 points__ of your overall course grade:

- __1 point__ for the proposal brainstorm
- __3 points__ for the project proposal
- __1 point__ for the revised project proposal

# Project Description

This quarter’s project theme will be __“Improve something out there”!__ This means you will have a unique chance to pick some interactive piece of tech that already exists and re-think it to make people happier about using it. Although you can start with something you know and love (or hate) you will also need to design for another group of people who is different from yourself. We will aim to make a really exciting design contribution to a product or service that will improve the user experience for different groups of people.

As part of your project, you will start from a design domain that you are really interested into, for example, traveling, gaming, health care, etc. Then, you will need to define what are the specific user needs your project will support and what activity you would like to design that will help address these needs.
Think about how that activity is currently supported, what doesn't work about current ways of supporting it, and how your solution will do this better. 
The specificity of addressing particular groups of people allows you to deeply think about what makes each group unique and how your solution will best support them. So, dive in and see what you can come up with! 

## Thinking Broad

Think about the problems that people face in their lives, how we can approach those problems, and the role for interactive technology.
Your proposal MUST go beyond a technology-centric proposal of a webpage, phone application, or interaction. 
This first assignment is your opportunity to think broadly about __identifying a real and relevant problem__. Subsequent assignments will provide opportunities to focus on designing a specific technological solution to a specific set of tasks.

Do not start with a focus on concrete one-time tasks (e.g., logging into your bank account). 
Instead identify problems in long-lived activities that span many different social or technological contexts. 
If you want to help people manage their money, do not immediately propose a website that addresses one specific task. 
Instead consider the range of other opportunities (e.g., personal mobile devices, shared family computers, point of sale systems).

Focus on improving a specific application or service that addresses the issues of specific people.
You must be able to create and evaluate a design within the timeframe of this course, so consider whether you 
can reasonably gain access to the necessary people.

We encourage you to think big, expanding your thinking to include new ideas for interaction techniques or technology platforms.
__Do not feel constrained by current devices__, but instead aim to explore an exciting design that could potentially motivate the development of new enabling technology. For example, see how Artefact presents the Dialog concept.
This concept has not been implemented, and might not even be immediately possible.
But it has been developed in substantial detail, understanding implications for design and implementation:

- [Dialog: Better Decisions, Better Health - Artefact](http://www.artefactgroup.com/content/work/dialog/)
- [Video of Dialog Talk in DUB Seminar](http://vimeo.com/103167385)

Finally, the project requires that your proposal presents __contrasting diverse groups of users__.
But you will ultimately follow your design process where it leads you.
Focusing on problems and opportunities, rather than specific design features will leave room for your design
to emerge and be refined in the course of this project.

# Deliverables

<a name="project_brainstorm"></a>

## 1a: Project Brainstorm

Due: {{ page.due_project_1a }}

Friday's section will focus on brainstorming potential project directions. You will get started on thinking, and help seed this brainstorming project, with some individual ideas.

You should upload the assignment individually, building on the ideas that your group had during the brainstorm in section. (It is okay to upload the same ideas as others in your group.)

Propose three sets of domains, problems, and goals you would like to tackle in this course.

By domain, we mean an aspect of daily life. Domains include:

- Traveling
- Shopping
- Gaming
- Health care
- Working

Be sure to focus on problems and goals, not potential design solutions. One way to help yourself identify a hierarchy of problems and goals is to ask "why?". For example:

- Why do my friends prefer Yelp instead of Google Maps?   
- Why is social media so overwhelming?
- Why is my girlfriend unable to play shooter games?

Each idea should be a single sentence, identifying the domain and the problem or goal. At most one of your ideas may come from any of the domains above. Your other two ideas should be from domains not in this list, in order to broaden the brainstorm. Ensure the ideas are significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.

### Submission

Ensure your name and section are at the top of your submission.

No more than one page of text in PDF format. Submit via Canvas here: 

{% if page.link_project_1a != nil %}<{{ page.link_project_1a }}>{% else %}`Link to be added`{% endif %}

If you are still attempting to add, or otherwise unable to access the submission system, submit via the instructor email address.

In section, be prepared to contribute your initial ideas as part of a larger brainstorm.

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __1 point__:

- 0.33 points for each unique proposed idea (i.e., do not submit small variations on the same idea).

## 1b: Project Proposal

Due: {{ page.due_project_1b }}

Propose and analyze a problem that could form the basis of a design project for this class. (Making use of high-quality references is strongly recommended.)

In one paragraph, describe the problem you want to tackle and motivations behing it. 
This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering. 
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.

In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and context. 
Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. 
A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims.
If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

Ensure your report is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - text should be clear and concise
 - use section headings as appropriate
 - include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate figure numbers and captions
 - refer to the figures in the body of your text
 - check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors

Be sure your presentation looks good:

 - choose appropriate colors, fonts, and styles
 - make liberal use of whitespace 


### Submission

Ensure your name and section are at the top of your submission.

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free. 
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

Submit via Canvas here:

{% if page.link_project_1b != nil %}<{{ page.link_project_1b }}>{% else %}`Link to be added`{% endif %}

### Grading

This proposal will be graded on a scale of __3 points__:

1. __Problem and Motivation__: (1 points)
2. __Analysis of Problem__: (1 points)
3. __Novelty and Creativity__: (0.5 points)
4. __Report Clarity and Presentation__: (0.5 points)

## 1c: Revised Project Proposal

Due: {{ page.due_project_1c }}

Update the project proposal based on the feedback you received from the staff. Describe the changes that you made from the previous version in one to two paragraphs. 

### Submission

The submission should describe the changes made from the previous verion on the first page, followed by the updated proposal. 

{% if page.link_project_1c != nil %}<{{ page.link_project_1c }}>{% else %}`Link to be added`{% endif %}

### Grading

The revised proposal will be graded on a scale of __1 point__:

1. __Changes explained__: (0.25 points)
2. __Proposal Revision__: (0.5 points)
3. __Report Clarity and Presentation__: (0.25 points)
